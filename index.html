          <h2>club newsletter</h2>

          <p>we can now give you an update on whether we will be getting a new local hobbyshop. at this point in time we will not be opening an onsite store for the club.
            the reason for this is that with the amount of members that we have we would not be able to order large amount of stock, meaning that we would have to charge at higher amounts than other stores. we are currently negotiating a club discount for full members at several hobby stores, who will be able to stock a larger range at better prices.
          </p>
